List of actions:

1) Create a github account
2) Install GitBash & VSCode on your computer ( If mac, just install git by using "brew install git" )
3) Create a repo named "learn-shell" and this is where we are going to host or upload all our work ( Public repo )
4) Open your gitBash, create a folder named b58 ( mkdir b58/ )
5) cd b58/ ---> then doa git clone "https url of your repo" , this is going to create the repo
6) On your gitbash, "# code learn-shell" , this will open the folder on your VSCode

Going forwared we are going to do the same for all the repositories.

### Basic Git Commands ( Which we are going to do continuously )
